# CAB-301-Assignement-3
University project for algorithms class. The purpose of this assesment was to take a list of jobs that have a time of completion and dependancies (jobs which need to be completed prior) and implement some sorting algorithms to show the user the best order to adress tasks in, as well as the earliest time each task could possibly be started. 

The Assignment implements these algorithms in a console application which prompts the user for the name of a text file containing the job information and then displays optoins for sorting and altering the data as well as saving functionality.
